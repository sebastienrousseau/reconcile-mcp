"""Check this package's tree against what is actually published.

`reconcile-mcp` ships on its own rather than as one member of a versioned
suite, so there is no sibling to compare against. The failure worth
catching here is the single-package one:

* **A version bumped in the tree and never released.** Three
  repositories in this suite have done exactly that, each time stranding
  a `cryptography` advisory floor that reached nobody. Nothing fails when
  it happens -- the tree is consistent, the tests pass, the changelog is
  written -- and only the index disagrees.

* **A tree left behind what was published.** Rarer, and usually a sign
  that a release was cut from somewhere other than `main`.

Exits non-zero when the two disagree, so a schedule turns into a
notification rather than a report nobody opens. A tree that is ahead
between merging a bump and pushing its tag is the expected transient
state, and is reported as such rather than as a hard error.
